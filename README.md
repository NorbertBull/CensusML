# Project Summary
This project used machine learning tools from the Python scikit-learn library to create a predictive model for income based on factors including age, marital status, education level, and occupation type. Training data were sourced from United States Census Bureau data. The final model is able to predict whether an individual makes greater than $50,000 per year with approximately 80% accuracy.

The app was created in a Jupyter Notebook for ease of submission and grading. This made it a little challenging to get the interactive elements working once the notebook was hosted in Heroku.
