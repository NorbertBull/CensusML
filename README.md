# CensusML

# Project Summary
This project used machine learning tools from the Python scikit-learn library to create a predictive model for income based on factors including age, marital status, education level, and occupation type. Training data were sourced from United States Census Bureau data. The final model is able to predict whether an individual makes greater than $50,000 per year with approximately 80% accuracy.

The app was created in a Jupyter Notebook, and originally hosted on Heroku using Voila (no longer - but should still use usable in the regular old notebook).
